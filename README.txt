==============================================================
  Legacy Wheel Hub  v1.1.5
  A free control panel for legacy Logitech force-feedback wheels
  (Driving Force GT, G25 and G27).
==============================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------
 IMPORTANT - INSTALL THE WHEEL DRIVERS FIRST
-------------------------------------------------------------
This app does NOT include any Logitech drivers. Before using it
on Windows 10/11, install the community driver package from:

    https://github.com/Mysli0210/Legacy-Logitech-wheels-for-W11

Follow that project's instructions, reboot if asked, then open
Legacy Wheel Hub and plug in your wheel.

-------------------------------------------------------------
 USING THE APP
-------------------------------------------------------------
- Set the rotation range and Force Feedback strength, then press APPLY.
- Tip: set "Overall Effects Strength" to 101% to remove the center
  FFB deadzone in most games (restart the game afterwards).
- FFB TEST: try the motor directly while no game is using the wheel.
- INPUT MONITOR: check every button and axis live.
- Enable "Auto-load on connect" to apply your settings automatically
  once the wheel finishes its power-on calibration.
- PROFILES: selecting a profile applies its settings instantly. You can
  assign a game .exe and a LUT to each profile.
- CENTERING RAMP: controls how sharply the centering force builds up
  around center. Higher = tighter center, lower = softer. Default is 7.
  Same strength with a different ramp feels very different - try it.
- Each game's LUT setting is now fully independent: whichever profile
  happens to be shown on screen no longer affects a different game's
  proxy. If you were using LUTs before this version, reinstall the
  proxy DLL once per game (toggle "FFB post-processing" off and back
  on, or re-add the profile) so it picks up this fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------
 GLOBAL LUT (FFB post-processing)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Gear-driven wheels (G25/G27/DFGT) have a force-feedback deadzone near
center. A LUT curve remaps the game's force so small inputs are felt,
for a more linear response - even in games without built-in LUT support.

  1. LUT tab -> "Import LUT" to add a .lut file (generate one for your
     wheel with WheelCheck + LUT Generator). You can keep several and
     choose a different one per profile.
  2. Tick "Enable FFB post-processing".
  3. Edit/create a profile and choose the game's .exe. The app copies a
     small dinput8.dll helper next to that game so its force feedback is
     routed through your LUT.

Do NOT use a LUT in sims that already have their own (Assetto Corsa,
ACC, iRacing) - it would double the curve.

  !! ONLINE GAMES: Do not use the LUT / dinput8.dll helper in online
     games. Some anti-cheat systems may flag third-party DLLs next to
     the game. If you use it online, it is AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Your settings are stored per-user at:
    %APPDATA%\Legacy Wheel Hub\settings.json
Imported LUTs and the helper log live in the app's own "luts" folder.
