Control panel for the Logitech Driving Force GT, G25 and G27 on Windows 10/11.
Replaces what Logitech Gaming Software used to do: rotation range, force
feedback strength, spring and damper, per-game profiles, and a LUT curve in
games that have no LUT of their own.

## Setup

Install the wheel drivers first. Nothing here ships Logitech drivers:

> https://github.com/Mysli0210/Legacy-Logitech-wheels-for-W11

Then grab `LegacyWheelHub_Setup.exe` from [Releases](../../releases). Plug the
wheel in, set what you want, hit APPLY.

SmartScreen will warn about the installer being unsigned. More info → Run anyway.

## What it does

- Rotation range, 40–900°, with presets
- Overall strength, spring, damper, centering spring, centering ramp
- Profiles per game: settings, rotation and LUT all switch when the game starts
- LUT support in games that don't have it
- Telemetry and input monitor for checking buttons, axes and pedals
- FFB test bench: push, spring, sweep, pulse, vibration
- Auto-load on connect, start with Windows, tray minimize
- EN / TR / DE / UK / RU, light and dark

Settings go to `%APPDATA%\Legacy Wheel Hub\settings.json`.

## LUT

Gear-driven wheels lose small forces to friction, so the wheel feels dead
around center. A LUT remaps the game's output to compensate.

Import a `.lut` in the LUT tab, tick Enable FFB post-processing, and assign
the game in the profile. Build your own curve with WheelCheck + LUT Generator,
or reuse one per profile.

Skip this in Assetto Corsa, ACC and iRacing. They already apply their own LUT
and you'd get the curve twice.

**Online games:** this drops a `dinput8.dll` next to the game executable.
Anti-cheat may not like that. Your call, your risk.
